# Comparing Dice Roll Probabilities: Uniform vs. Biased Scenarios

These programs are available in this repository:

* DiceRoll.py [Python]

# Utilization

The usage of two separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy      (python)
* scipy      (python)

# Example usage

The python file `DiceRoll.py` can be run from the command line by typing:

`<> python DiceRoll.py`

This requires a working `Python` distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package `numpy`, 'scipy' and `Matplotlib` also installed.
